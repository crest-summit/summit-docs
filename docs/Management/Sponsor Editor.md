The Sponsor Management section was designed as a tool to manage the Sponsors in Summit.  A Promoted Sponsor is one for which the official name, type, VT Identifier and any applicable abbreviation has been included.  Also included in Promoted Sponsors is a keyword field from which OVPR can manage specific requirements and notification (see Sponsor Keywords section below).

## Navigation Pane

**Pending Review**

A sponsor in Pending Review is one that was confirmed as a new sponsor in the Proposal Initiator or Proposal Editor.  This means that the User searched for the sponsor name and did not find it in the list of Promoted Sponsors provided.
The sponsors in the Pending Review are listed by creation date.

**Promoted**

A sponsor in the Promoted list is one that has been reviewed by the designated OSP “Sponsor Vetter.”  This means the information on the sponsor has been reviewed and confirmed as accurate and complete..
The sponsors in the Promoted list are in alphabetical order by abbreviation (or name if no abbreviation)

**Deactivated**

A sponsor in the Deactivated list is one that the designated OSP “Sponsor Vetter” has indicated is no longer an active sponsor.  The sponsor may have closed or merged with another.  A Deactivated sponsor can also be a sponsor the system automatically moved from the pending list to the Deactivated list when sponsor name changed on the proposal with which it was associated and therefore this “old” name has no associated proposal.

**Deactivated**

The Summary view for sponsors in the Deactivated list shows the sponsor abbreviation, name, VT Identifier and date on which it was deactivated.  They are listed in alphabetical order by full name.  The Deactivated list contains both those rejected from Pending and Deactivated from Promoted so those that were rejected without completing the fields will have less information available.
