**Navigation / Workflow**

### Preparing
"Preparing" is the first state a work is in when newly created from the Get Started initiation screen.  There is no label or icon in the Summary view or top left of the Editor header.  Most of the work done will be completed in this stage before it is routed for approvals.

### Administrative Review
When a proposal is in Admin Review, a warning icon will display at the top right of the Summary View and label in the header of the editor.  The icon appears in My Open and All Open navigation items.  This state is only shown as a tag and can be given at the same time as any other status in the Open folder.

Works appear in Admin Review in the following circumstances:

-	When the Technical Documents have not been marked received by OSP according to OSP Policy 10-01, the status is not "In Routing", "Approved", or "Submitted", and the sponsor deadlines is Today.
-	The proposal has been manually marked for Administrative Review
Pre-Award Management is responsible for reviewing all proposals in Admin Review and determining if they may be submitted.

### In Routing
When a proposal is ready to be routed for Departmental and College or Institute approval, any full access User can initiate the routing process. All approvers and delegates assigned to the proposal are notified to approve the proposal. This action in Summit will give it the status of "In Routing" as shown below.  More details about the process can be found [here](../Approvals/Routing.md).

### Approved
This status is achieved when all organizations on the proposal have approved and the status changes from "In Routing" to "Approved". More details about the approval process can be found [here](../Approvals/Approving.md).

### Submitted
If a proposal has been marked as submitted (but not yet closed) while in Open, a submitted icon will display at the top right of the Summary View and "Submitted" label in the Editor header.  The Icon appears in the My Open and All Open navigation items.

### Submission finalized
Once a proposal has been submitted to the sponsor and all work has been completed by Pre Award in Summit, the proposal is transitioned to the Awaiting Banner folder and given the status of "Submission Finalized".  This is where OSP Processors will then enter the proposal information into Banner for official record keeping.

### Pending Decision
After the proposal has been entered into Banner, it is transitioned to the Pending Decision folder and given the "Pending Decision" status where it awaits a decision by the sponsor.

### Closed Reasons
When a proposal has been marked as Closed by Pre-Award, the reason for closure will display in the header.  The status is displayed in My Closed and All Closed (example below shows a proposal closed for Awarded and Abandoned).
