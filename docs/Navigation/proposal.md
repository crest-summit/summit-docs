The full name of the organization and sponsor can be seen by hovering over the item in the summary

Pending proposals are displayed in the Summary View in order by target date with the soonest target date displaying first.   Note that when there is no Target Date provided, the system defaults the Sponsor Deadline date to the Target Date field.

##All Open
The “All Open” navigation item displays all current open proposals on which the User is listed as part of the Support Staff or Proposal Team, regardless of role or Submitting Org.   Proposals in All Open are displayed in order by target date with the most recent first.

The “All Open” navigation item expands to display a folder for each PI on which the User is listed as part of the Support Staff or Proposal Team.

For the **Support Team** All Open contains:
- Proposals on which they are listed as Support Staff, Support Staff Lead or Creator
- A folder for each PI who has an open proposal with the User listed as Support Staff, Support Staff Lead or Creator.  These could be PIs in other departments when the User is listed as Support Staff for a proposal with a PI from a different department (i.e., if faculty from the User’s department is listed as Co-PI)

#Proposal Summary View Indicators
Within the Summary view for proposals, there are several indicators that will appear in specific circumstances as a quick reference for the User.

###New and Unviewed Proposals
Within the User’s My Open Proposals, any newly created and unviewed proposals display in bold with a blue bar on the left side of the Summary.  This indicator only appears in My Open, not All Open or other navigation items.

###Sponsor Deadline
If the proposal has a sponsor deadline in addition to a target due date, a calendar icon will display to the left of the target date. Hovering over the calendar icon will reveal the sponsor deadline.  Note that the target date defaults to the sponsor deadline if no target date was entered but a sponsor deadline was.
