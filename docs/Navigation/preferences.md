## E-mail Notifications

Depending on your role within a proposal and if you have the proposal as a favorite, will determine what email notifications you will receive.  The one exception to this is if you are on the Proposal Team (PI, Co-PI, Proposal Team member) you will receive compliance email regardless of your email settings.

New Users to the system by default will have all email notifications turned on.

Below shows every email notification currently in Summit, what category that email corresponds to in the user preferences screen, who will receive that email, and any special circumstances around the email.

## Other Settings

**Default Research Organization**

Users associated with multiple organizations can indicate which organization they mainly conduct research under if it is different from their Home Org.  By clicking on the user name at the top right of the screen and choosing the User Preferences option, then Other Settings to the left, users can indicate a Default Research Organization.

![Manage Preferences for Default Research Organization](../images/navigation/NavPref_ManageDefault.png)

The organization listed here will be the pre-populated organization in the submitting org and responsible org fields:
- In the Proposal Initiation, the Default Research Organization defaults in the Submitting Organization field

![Pre-populated fields in the Initiator for Default Research Organization](../images/navigation/NavPref_PrePopulatedGetStarted.jpg)

- In the Proposal Editor, the Default Research Organization defaults in the Submitting Organization field as well as the Responsible Organization field.

![Pre-populated fields in the Editor for Default Research Organization](../images/navigation/NavPref_PrePopulatedEditor.jpg)

Users can still edit the fields for individual proposals. The Default Research Organization can be updated at any time and will only be used on new proposals.  It does not update current fields.
