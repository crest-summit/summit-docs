# Default Research Organization

Users associated with multiple organizations can indicate which organization they mainly conduct research under if it is different from their Home Org.  By clicking on the user name at the top right of the screen and choosing the Manage Preferences option, users can indicate a Default Research Organization.

Users can still edit the fields for individual proposals. The Default Research Organization can be updated at any time and will only be used on new proposals.  It does not update current fields.
