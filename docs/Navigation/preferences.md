## Default Research Organization

Users associated with multiple organizations can indicate which organization they mainly conduct research under if it is different from their Home Org.  By clicking on the user name at the top right of the screen and choosing the Manage Preferences option, users can indicate a Default Research Organization.

The organization listed here will be the pre-populated organization in the submitting org and responsible org fields:
- In the Proposal Initiation, the Default Research Organization defaults in the Submitting Organization field

- In the Proposal Editor, the Default Research Organization defaults in the Submitting Organization field as well as the Responsible Organization field.

Users can still edit the fields for individual proposals. The Default Research Organization can be updated at any time and will only be used on new proposals.  It does not update current fields.

## E-mail Preferences

A user can add/change 2 E-mail related settings in their manage preferences:

1. Unsubscribe from Summit external communications
    - If you are a named **Proposal Team member** (PI, Co-PI, Proposal Team member), then this will only unsubscribe you from emails being sent when the user creates a proposal.  All other emails that Summit sends is considered essential and will be sent (ex. DoD notice).
    - If you are a **support staff member** on an org associated with a named Proposal Team member, then clicking unsubscribe will remove you from all Summit e-mail communications.

2. Preferred E-mail Address
    - By default the email listed here will be the user's pid + @vt.edu, but users can elect to use another email address for Summit communication emails.
