**Navigation / Notifications**

The Notification function in Summit is designed to assist the User in managing their workload by updating the User when others have commented or changed a status.  

# Navigating the Notifications
Notifications are located at the top of the Navigation pane.  When there are new notifications, a number badge appears next to Notifications indicating how many new notifications there are since notifications was last opened. Opening the Notifications will remove the badge.
