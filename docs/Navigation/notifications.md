**Navigation / Notifications**

The Notification function in Summit is designed to assist the User in managing their workload by updating the User when others have commented or changed a status.  

# Navigating the Notifications
Notifications are located at the top of the Navigation pane.  When there are new notifications, a number badge appears next to Notifications:

Clicking on the notification takes the User to the applicable section of the proposal and marks it as read.
