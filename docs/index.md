# <img src="../images/warning.png" alt="Warning" style="float:left; width:39px; height:39px;"> Known Issues
- Proposal creation fails when a PI does not have a home org in Banner or default home org in Summit.  
    - **Workaround**: The PI should work with their department to update Banner to add their home org or add a default home org in managed preferences.
- Notifications on Cost Share and Subcontractors
    - Due to the Cost Share and Subcontractor sections being tabulated, it is currently not possible for the notifications to scroll to a particular comment within these two sections.  It will only scroll if the comment happens to be on the tab that is currently open.  If the comment is on a tab that is not open, it will open the comment thread at the top right of the proposal screen.
- CAS Forbidden Login Message
    - If you login to Summit and CAS is set to 7 day reminder; then logout of Summit/CAS, then try to log back into Summit again, the Forbidden Access message will appear.
    - **Workaround**: Refresh the page

# FAQs
**How do I add a support staff or approver on an org?**

- The Department Head or Business Manager of the org in question should email <summitHelp@vt.edu> with the name of who they would like added and as what role type(s) (ex. support staff, support staff lead, approver, approver delegate).
