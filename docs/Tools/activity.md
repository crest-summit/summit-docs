**Tools / Activity Log**

# Activity Log

The Activity log is located in the toolbar at the top right of the proposal.

![Activity Log Location](../images/tools/ToolActivity_LogLocation.jpg)

It contains a history of the activity that has occurred in the proposal.  Each entry is documented with the date and time and the person who made the change.

If the entry is a system change, "system" is listed as the person making the change.  For example, when there is an automatic status update, the Activity Log will show that the "system" made the change.

For changes, the old information is gray and the new information that replaced it is normal font.
