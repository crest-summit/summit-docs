Files can be uploaded into Summit from a requirement, a question, or a specific file field such as the solicitation document field or the third party cost share commitment letter field.

# File Actions
Each uploaded file has a set of actions available to it.  An action gear will appear next to the file when the User hovers over a file:

The action gear menu changes depending upon user and the document status.  The following details each item on the menu and which users have access when.

## Add Comment

## Upload New Version
Available to all Users for all Files.  Once a file is uploaded from the Checklist Action Gear, there is an option to “Upload New Version.”  Uploading a new version allows the user to “replace” the current version with an update.  Clicking on this action will bring a popup window allowing the User to drag or search for the file.

All the actions associated with a file except comment are accessible in the Files log.  Clicking on the file location will take the User to the file in the proposal editor.  Clicking on the file name will open the file in a separate window.
