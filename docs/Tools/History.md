### Display

Below shows the display in Summit when a user clicks "History".  

![Tools History Sequence](../images/tools/ToolHistory_Sequence.jpg)

Sorted by creation date, the earliest work will be at the bottom and most recent created at the top.  

In the example above the user started with a Pre-proposal, then advanced to a Proposal, then advanced the Proposal to another Proposal making it a revision.  Lastly, the user advanced the Proposal (Revision) to a Continuation.

All types of work in that cycle can be accessed from any another work while having the History display up, simply click the hyperlink of the Proposal ID you wish to navigate to and that work will open.

### Revision Handeling

Currently the only type of work to display "(Revision)" is on proposals that are advanced from a proposal.  Any other type of work advacned to itself will not display the "(Revision)" tag after the work type.
