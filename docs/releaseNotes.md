**Get Started** will have all 3 options as seen above

- **Start New Work** will allow a user to create a new Proposal, Pre-Proposal, White Paper, or Letter of Intent.

- **Advance Existing Work** will allow a user to advance an existing Proposal, Pre-Proposal, White Paper or Letter of Intent to the next stage in its lifecycle or create a revision of any type of work.

- **Supplement/Continue Existing Grant** will allow a user to create a work item to request additional funding on an existing grant.

#### **2. Advance redesign**

**Advance** from within a proposal and you will see the same options as you do in the Get Started, except "Start New Work".

- Both options within this screen will automatically pull the proposal ID from the work the user was currently in.  By pulling in the proposal ID, it will also pull in all necessary data from the original proposal, to put on the newly advanced work.   

<br>

#### **3. Types of Work updated**
We have removed "Revision" and "Other" as a Types of Work.  For "Revision", you are now able to revise to the Type of Work you're are advancing from (ex. "Proposal" to "Proposal").  For "Other", you can specify if it is a "Supplement" or "Continuation".  This brings the current Type of Works that can be used in Summit as: White Paper, Letter of Intent, Pre-Proposal, Proposal, Supplement, Continuation

<br>

#### **4. History Log**
Users will now have the ability to view a list of all Types of Work that have been linked to each other via the advance feature.

Below shows the display in Summit when a user clicks "History".  Sorted by creation date, the earliest work will be at the bottom and most recent created at the top.  All types of work in that cycle can be accessed from another other work while having the History display up, simply click the hyperlink of the Proposal ID.

    Note: The History Log will only show work created after the release of this new feature, 8/18/17.  Works advanced before then will not display in the history log

#### **5. Minor Updates**  
- Compliance questions updated (OESRC and IRB)
    - Newly created proposals will only have the new questions.
    - All existing proposals will have the new OESRC questions added alongside the older ones.  
    - Before a proposal can be routed, the new questions will need to be answered by PI/Proposal team.    
    - Proposals already In-Routing or Approved will have those questions added as well but they will **NOT** be needed to be answered to get the proposal to next status level.
- Year Displayed in the Proposal Summary if not current year
- CDA/NDA requirement question added in the Submission Information section
- Various Bug Fixes
- Increased proposal summary pane width (Updated view shown below)
