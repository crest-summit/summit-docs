- **Advance Existing Work** will allow a user to advance an existing Proposal, Pre-Proposal, White Paper or Letter of Intent to the next stage in its lifecycle or create a revision of any type of work.

- **Supplement/Continue Existing Grant** will allow a user to create a work item to request additional funding on an existing grant.

#### **2. Advance redesign**

**Advance** from within a proposal and you will see the same options as you do in the Get Started, except "Start New Work".

- Both options within this screen will automatically pull the proposal ID from the work the user was currently in.  By pulling in the proposal ID, it will also pull in all necessary data from the original proposal, to put on the newly advanced work.

#### **3. Types of Work updated**
We have removed "Revision" and "Other" as a Types of Work.  For "Revision", you are now able to revise to the Type of Work you're are advancing from (ex. "Proposal" to "Proposal").  For "Other", you can specify if it is a "Supplement" or "Continuation".  This brings the current Type of Works that can be used in Summit as: White Paper, Letter of Intent, Pre-Proposal, Proposal, Supplement, Continuation

<br>

#### **4. History Log**
Users will now have the ability to view a list of all Types of Work that have been linked to each other via the advance feature.

Below shows the display in Summit when a user clicks "History".  Sorted by creation date, the earliest work will be at the bottom and most recent created at the top.  All types of work in that cycle can be accessed from another other work while having the History display up, simply click the hyperlink of the Proposal ID.
