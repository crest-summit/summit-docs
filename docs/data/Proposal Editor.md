The Proposal Editor contains topical sections for proposal data and checklists.  After Proposal Initiation, the Proposal Editor contains all of the information provided in the Initiator and also includes additional fields and sections.  The following is a brief overview of the additional sections and features of the Proposal Editor.
# Personnel
In the Editor, the Personnel section is split into four sections:  The Submitting Org, the Proposal Team, the Support Staff, and the Personnel Requirements.

## The Submitting Organization
This field contains the Submitting Organization included in the Proposal Initiation.  If it is different from the PI Home Org, the option is provided to change it back to PI Home Org.

## Proposal Team
The Proposal Team section initially includes only the PI.  Additional Team Members can be added by clicking the “Add Proposal Team Member” button.

Each person listed can be edited or deleted by clicking on the gear icon that appears when the User hovers over a specific Proposal Team Member:

Though all the fields are editable, there are several validations that will prevent the User from saving the proposal:

 - There must be a PI on the proposal.  If the PI role is changed or the PI is deleted, the User will receive a warning:

 - If more than one person is listed as a PI the User will receive a warning that only one is permitted:

 - Persons listed in the Support Staff section cannot be added to the Proposal Team unless they are first deleted from the Support Staff section:

## Support Staff
Support Staff includes the assigned Pre-Award Associate as well as any department or college administrative personnel who require access to the proposal.  This may include grant administrators, business managers or project managers.

There are several unique features for Support Staff:

-	Some Support Staff are automatically included for the Submitting Organization that was entered at the Proposal Initiation.  OSP maintains a list of required Support Staff for each organization.  

-	Deleting Support Staff for the Submitting Org that are automatically included will generate a notice suggesting they be included:

- Changing the Submitting Org will generate a notice suggestion the support staff associated with the new org be included:

- Support Staff can be designated as Support Staff Lead.   This role indicates that the Support Staff will see the proposals on which they are marked as Lead in their “My Open” navigation item.  This can be done automatically through the OSP maintained list or by manually editing the role.  There is no limit on the number of Support Staff that can have the Support Staff Lead role.

## Personnel Requirements

## Access Levels
All personnel are given full access by default when they are added to the proposal.  This means that they have full access to view, edit, save and perform proposal actions.  Persons given limited access will only have access to see a summary view of the proposal.  PI’s cannot be given limited access.  If the User tries to change their own or the PI’s access from Full to Limited they will receive the following error message:

# Submission Information
## Instructions
The Submission Information Instructions Subsection includes data fields describing the submission instructions such as how and when the proposal must be submitted and any specific requirements such as a solicitation or master agreement.

Answering yes to the questions in this section will create new requirements elsewhere in the Proposal Editor.

## Submission Requirements

## Sponsor

## Policy
This subsection contains checklist and data for OSP personnel to manage the status of the proposal.  The Administrative Documents Received Checklist item tracks the receipt of documents in compliance with OSP Policy 10-01. Administrative documents can be attached here and the notes feature used to communicate about them.  The SPAF should be attached to the Administrative Documents checklist item.   See “Checklist” section below for information on how to use the checklist.

## Science and Technical Documents
This subsection currently includes only a checklist item for Technical Documents Received.  Except for proposals being submitted through Cayuse or Fastlane, the Support Staff User must attach the proposal documents to be submitted to the sponsor in the Technical Documents checklist item.  This should include the full proposal the Pre-Award Associate will submit to the sponsor.  The checklist is marked complete to track compliance with OSP Policy 10-01.
