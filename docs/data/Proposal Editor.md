The Proposal Editor contains topical sections for proposal data and checklists.  After Proposal Initiation, the Proposal Editor contains all of the information provided in the Initiator and also includes additional fields and sections.  The following is a brief overview of the additional sections and features of the Proposal Editor.
# Personnel
In the Editor, the Personnel section is split into four sections:  The Submitting Org, the Proposal Team, the Support Staff, and the Personnel Requirements.

## The Submitting Organization
This field contains the Submitting Organization included in the Proposal Initiation.  If it is different from the PI Home Org, the option is provided to change it back to PI Home Org.

If the Submitting Organization is changed in the Proposal Editor:
-	The Pre-Award Associate remains the same.  If the new organization should be assigned to a new Pre-Award Administrator, it can be done manually at the Pre-Award Associate’s discretion.
-	Support Staff are not automatically removed from the proposal, but can be deleted manually.  The User is given a warning if there is additional support staff from this new organization that should be added to the Support Staff section.

## Proposal Team
The Proposal Team section initially includes only the PI.  Additional Team Members can be added by clicking the “Add Proposal Team Member” button.

Each person listed can be edited or deleted by clicking on the gear icon that appears when the User hovers over a specific Proposal Team Member:

Though all the fields are editable, there are several validations that will prevent the User from saving the proposal:

 - There must be a PI on the proposal.  If the PI role is changed or the PI is deleted, the User will receive a warning in the Editor and an error on the Save button:

 - If more than one person is listed as a PI the User will receive a warning in the Editor that only one is permitted and an error on the Save button:

 - Persons listed in the Support Staff section cannot be added to the Proposal Team unless they are first deleted from the Support Staff section:

## Support Staff
Support Staff includes the assigned Pre-Award Associate as well as any department or college administrative personnel who require access to the proposal.  This may include grant administrators, business managers or project managers.

There are several unique features for Support Staff:

-	Some Support Staff are automatically included for the Submitting Organization that was entered at the Proposal Initiation.  OSP maintains a list of required Support Staff for each organization.  

-	Deleting Support Staff for the Submitting Org that are automatically included will generate a notice suggesting they be included:

- Changing the Submitting Org will generate a notice suggestion the support staff associated with the new org be included:

DataEd_ChangeOrgSS IMAGE HERE

- Support Staff can be designated as Support Staff Lead.   This role indicates that the Support Staff will see the proposals on which they are marked as Lead in their “My Open” navigation item.  This can be done automatically through the OSP maintained list or by manually editing the role.  There is no limit on the number of Support Staff that can have the Support Staff Lead role.

## Access Levels
All personnel are given full access by default when they are added to the proposal.  This means that they have full access to view, edit, save and perform proposal actions.  Persons given limited access will only have access to see a summary view of the proposal.  PI’s cannot be given limited access.  If the User tries to change their own or the PI’s access from Full to Limited they will receive the following error message:

## Personnel Requirements
Within the Personnel Section is a Requirements Subsection listing all requirements regarding personnel that need to be reviewed before the proposal is submitted.  See the Tools/Requirements section for more information on using the Requirements feature.

# Submission Information
## Instructions and Instruction Requirements
The Submission Information Instructions Subsection includes data fields describing the submission instructions such as how and when the proposal must be submitted and any specific requirements such as a solicitation or master agreement.  See the Tools/Requirements section for more information on using the Requirements feature.

Answering yes to the questions in this section will create new requirements elsewhere in the Proposal Editor.  For example, if there is a "yes" answer to "Is this a limited submission," the following item will be added the Submission Instruction Requirements list:

DataEd_LimitedSubExample IMAGE HERE

The first item in the Submission Instruction Requirements list asks if there are any unique RFP Instructions or Submission Requirements.  This item should be used to communicate and track unique requirements such as specific file types to be emailed or if there are different deadlines for separate sections of the proposal.

## Policy
This subsection contains checklist and data for OSP personnel to manage the status of the proposal.  The Administrative Documents Received Checklist item tracks the receipt of documents in compliance with OSP Policy 10-01. Administrative documents can be attached here and the notes feature used to communicate about them.  The SPAF should be attached to the Administrative Documents checklist item.   See the Tools/Requirements section for more information on using the Requirements feature.

## Science and Technical Documents
This subsection currently includes only a checklist item for Technical Documents Received.  Except for proposals being submitted through Cayuse or Fastlane, the Support Staff User must attach the proposal documents to be submitted to the sponsor in the Technical Documents checklist item.  This should include the full proposal the Pre-Award Associate will submit to the sponsor.  The checklist is marked complete to track compliance with OSP Policy 10-01. See the Tools/Requirements section for more information on using the Requirements feature.

# Budget
If a Budget Request was made during the Proposal Initiation, the information displays in this section.  If no Budget Request was made, the option to request a budget is available:

DateEd_BudgetRequest IMAGE HERE

Requesting a budget will open a dialogue box similar to the Initiate Proposal wizard in which the User will be asked to complete the required data fields. Once the request is complete, it will display in the Budget Information section along with the additional budget fields available.

DataEd_BudReqForm IMAGE HERE

After a Budget Request is made, this section will display the data fields associated with the budget, including new fields that will need to be completed.

##Development
The Budget Development subsection contains the budget documents and budget details included in the original budget request information.  It is meant to be used for the communication around the development of the final budget(s).  Using the standard Requirements actions, budget development allows for attaching files, viewing and reverting to previous versions of files, commenting and replying as well as a unique feature of approving or rejecting a document.  See the Data/Budget Development and Tools/Requirements sections for details on using this feature.
