The purpose of the Summit Mobile Approver is to give the ability for approvers who normally use the desktop Summit application for approving proposals that are in routing the chance to also view, approve, and return for correction approvals using your mobile devise.

# Logging In
For each user, there may be multiple ways to get to the Mobile Approver on your mobile device.  The first way is to use the URL link in your devise web browser.  You'll still login via CAS as you would on the desktop.  Once you have the mobile approver displaying, then you can either save it as a bookmark or add it to your Home screen for quick access.

# Navigation
The same folders that appear in the Desktop version of Summit, will also appear in the Mobile Approver
