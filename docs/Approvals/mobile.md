**Approvals / Mobile Approver**

![Mobile Approver Logo](../images/approvals/mobileApproverLogo.png)

The purpose of the Summit Mobile Approver is to give the ability for approvers who normally use the desktop Summit application for approving proposals that are in routing the chance to also view, approve, and return for correction approvals using your mobile devise.

# Logging In
For each user, there may be multiple ways to get to the Mobile Approver on your mobile device.  The first way is to use the URL shown here, [https://mobile.summit.cloud.vt.edu/](https://mobile.summit.cloud.vt.edu/) and type it into your devise's web browser.  You'll still login via CAS as you would on the desktop.  Once signing in via CAS and have the mobile approver displaying, then you can either save it as a bookmark or add it to your Home screen for quick access.

Once logged in, you will first be taken to your "To Be Approved" folder.

**Cost Share**  
The cost share section will display the total cost share amount, rationale, and requirement for the cost share.  Each category of the cost share will also display, along with the individual item totals.

**Subcontractors**  
This section will show the name of the Subcontractor, as well as the name of the contact for the sub, their email, and their phone number.

**Compliance**  
Only compliance questions answered in the affirmative in the work editor from the desktop will show in this section (not every compliance answer will show, only ones that applicable and need attention).  For example, as you see below only two bullet points are shown indicating there will be research that involves Organization or Foreign Nationals and that the project will use Vertebrate Animals.

**Approval Decisions**  
This section shows the routing chains needed to get an approval into the "Approved" status.  Shown below is an example of a 2 organization routing chain, where the first organization "Building Construction" is the first needed approval.  Once one of the three approvers listed in "Building Construction" approve, it will be sent to the "College of Architecture" for approval.  Then when both organizations have approved, this approval will be "Approved" and the approval itself will be moved to the "Approved" folder.

# Actions

There are three actions a user can perform in the mobile approver, the same three actions that can be performed in the desktop approval.  The descriptions for the three are listed below:

![Mobile Buttons](../images/approvals/mobileButtons.png)

**Approve**  
After clicking "Approve" while in the Approval, it will pop-up a modal displaying all organizations you as the user have access to approve.  

![Mobile Approve Button](../images/approvals/mobileApproveButton.png)

Once you check the organization you are approving as (one or more can be selected), it will enable the "Approve" button to finalize your part of the approval and will then either send it to the next in the approval chain or approval the proposal.  If no organization is selected on this screen, then the "Approve" button will stay disabled.

**Return for Correction**  
Just as in the desktop version, an approver can send the approval back to the proposal team if a correction is needed.  

![Mobile Return Button](../images/approvals/mobileReturnButton.png)

When first selecting "Return for Correction" the modal will appear with the button disabled.  It is required to provide text that will be visible to all users with access to the proposal, as well as an email that will be sent to all applicable users giving your reason why you took the proposal out of routing.

**Remove Outdated Request**  
When a proposal is taken out of routing, the approval will stay in the To be Approved list where a user can acknowledge the cancellation.  The date, user that canceled routing, and the comment left by the user that canceled will appear the acknowledgment.
