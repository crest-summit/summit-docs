**Approvals / Approving**

# Approval Navigation
The Approval Navigation is visible to all Users though only Approvers will see proposals on which they are approvers here.

Located at the bottom of the left Navigation pane, the Approval section contains three subsections: To Be Approved, Pending and Approved.  The section can be collapsed or expanded.  When the navigation pane is collapsed, only the icons for the subfolders will show.

![Approval Navigation](../images/approvals/AppPro_Navigation.jpg)

**To be Approved**

All proposals waiting on the User's Organization for approval are listed in the Summary Pane. This could mean the User is required to approve or may allow for the approval of one of several authorized Approvers or Delegates. The gavel icon indicates a decision is waiting to be made.

**Pending**

All proposals on which the User is listed an approver or delegate that have not been approved by all required Organizations are listed in the Summary.  This means all proposals that will require the User's Organization approval after another party approves and proposals which the User's Organization has already approved and are waiting on another party's approval.  It also includes all the proposals included in "To be Approved."  The question mark icon indicates approval has not been granted by all parties.

**Approved**

All proposal that have been approved by all required Organizations are listed in the Summary Pane.  The checkmark icon indicated all required approvals have been granted.

**Canceled**

When a proposal needs to be updated while it routing, the routing can be canceled, updated, and then re-routed.  If a proposal needs to be updated after all approvals are received, the approval can be discarded and then the proposal updated and re-routed.  The Canceled folder contains all approvals that have been canceled or discarded, with a notification at the top indicating the circumstances.

# Approval Editor
Choosing a proposal from the summary view of any of the Approval folders will display a read-only Editor that contains subset of data from the Proposal Editor.  

![Approval Editor](../images/approvals/AppPro_Editor.jpg)

**Header**

The Header includes the proposal number, the PI, the proposal label and the Sponsor name.

![Approver Editor Header](../images/approvals/AppPro_Header.jpg)

**Approval Checkbox**

When a proposal is waiting on the User's Organization in "To Be Approved" or "Pending," there will be an Approval checkbox under the header.  Once any one of Approvers or delegates for the User's Organization have approved, this option is no longer available.

![Approver Checkbox](../images/approvals/AppPro_Checkbox.jpg)

**Approval Decisions**

This section lists all of the Organizations required to approve the proposal.  If there are multiple approval chains, they are designated by a separate subsection.

![One vs Multiple Approval Chains](../images/approvals/AppPro_ApprovalDecisions.jpg)

The above image illustrates the following:

- The User's Organization will be emphasized in blue when an approval is still required.  
- An organization that has no parent organization will have no chain of approvers but only have itself in the list.
- All organizations that have approved will have the approved indicator.
- The name of the approver and the date and time of approval are listed for all approvals.
- If one organization is in multiple chains, it will be listed in each but the approver for that organization will only need to approve once.

**Work Summary**

This section is a read-only summary of the data in the Proposal Editor.  

![Work Summary](../images/approvals/AppPro_WorkSummary.jpg)

Information that is grayed out in the Budget Information section indicates the proposal budget does not include these circumstances.

**Files**

The files log is located at the top of the approval editor next to the save button.  

![Files log access](../images/approvals/AppPro_AccessFiles.jpg)

The file log lists all files attached to the proposal.  The most recent version of each file can be accessed by clicking on the file name.

![File Log Modal](../images/approvals/AppPro_FileLog.jpg)

## Approving the Proposal
Approvers log in to Summit and see a list of proposals waiting for their approval in "Approvals / To Be Approved."  Choosing the Proposal in the Summary Pane will display a read-only view of the basic Proposal details in the Editor. To approve the proposal, the User starts by clicking the green "Approve" button in the top right of the approval.  

![Approval Buttons](../images/approvals/Approving_buttons.jpg)

Once clicked, a window will pop-up listing all the organizations pending their approval.  When only one organization is pending your approval, the "Approve" button will already be enabled.  

![Single Org Approve Modal](../images/approvals/Approving_singleOrgModal.jpg)

When multiple organizations are pending your approval, you will need to select all organizations you wish to approve, then the "Approve" button will become enabled.

![Multi Org Approve Modal](../images/approvals/Approving_multiOrgModal.jpg)

Once pressed, your approval will be recorded and the approval will move from your "To be approved" folder to "Pending" if others are still needed to approve.  If you were the last approver, it will move to the "Approved" folder.

    Note: Approvers listed in multiple approval chains will only receive a notification when all the chains are ready for their approval.

# Approvals in the Proposal

 Notice the following in the above:

 - A link to the budget chosen for routing is located at the top of the section

 - The pending icon (question mark) appears to the left of the organization name when that organization's approval is required for the approval process to proceed to the next level.

 - Clicking the down caret next to the organization name displays a list of the approver and approver delegates

 - Organizations that have approved have a checkmark.

 - The name of the person who approved and the time they approved displays on the right.

 - If an organization does not need to approve due to conditional approval preferences, it is is indicated to the left of the organization name.

# Approval History

The Approval History section logs all past routing actions for a proposal in the Proposal Management section of the Editor or in the Approval under the Approval Decisions section. The Approval Decisions section will still display, but is only for routing currently being done and thus will not be visible if the work is in the Preparing phase.
