**Approvals / Proposal Routing**

When a proposal is ready to routed for Departmental and College or Institute approval, any full access User can initiate the routing process.  All approvers and delegates assigned to the proposal are notified and must log in to Summit to review and approve the proposal.  Once the proposal is approved by required parties, the proposal may be submitted to the sponsor.

# Approval Navigation
The Approval Navigation is visible to all Users though only Approvers will see proposals on which they are approvers here.

Located at the bottom of the left Navigation pane, the Approval section contains three subsections: To Be Approved, Pending and Approved.  The section can be collapsed or expanded.  When the navigation pane is collapsed, only the icons for the subfolders will show.

**To be Approved**

All proposals waiting on the User's Organization for approval are listed in the Summary Pane. This could mean the User is required to approve or may allow for the approval of one of several authorized Approvers or Delegates. The gavel icon indicates a decision is waiting to be made.

**Pending**

All proposals on which the User is listed an approver or delegate that have not been approved by all required Organizations are listed in the Summary.  This means all proposals that will require the User's Organization approval after another party approves and proposals which the User's Organization has already approved and are waiting on another party's approval.  It also includes all the proposals included in "To be Approved."  The question mark icon indicates approval has not been granted by all parties.

**Approved**

All proposal that have been approved by all required Organizations are listed in the Summary Pane.  The checkmark icon indicated all required approvals have been granted.

# Approval Editor
Choosing a proposal from the summary view of any of the Approval folders will display a read-only Editor that contains subset of data from the Proposal Editor.

**Approval Checkbox**

When a proposal is waiting on the User's Organization in "To Be Approved" or "Pending," there will be an Approval checkbox under the header.  Once any one of Approvers or delegates for the User's Organization have approved, this option is no longer available.

**Approval Decisions**

This section lists all of the Organizations required to approve the proposal.  If there are multiple approval chains, they are designated by a separate subsection.

![One vs Multiple Approval Chains](../images/approvals/AppPro_ApprovalDecisions.jpg)

The User's Organization will be emphasized in blue when an approval is still required.  An organization that has no parent organization will have no chain of approvers but only have itself in the list. All organizations that have approved will have the approved indicator.

![Parent Orgs](../images/approvals/AppPro_Parent.jpg)

If one organization is in multiple chains, it will be listed in each but the approver for that organization will only need to approve once.

**Work Summary**
This section is a read-only summary of the data in the Proposal Editor.

The files log is located at the top of the approval editor next to the save button.  

![Files log access](../images/approvals/AppPro_AccessFiles.jpg)

The file log lists all files attached to the proposal.  The most recent version of each file can be accessed by clicking on the file name.

## Approver Assignment
(how they get assigned etc)

The approvers/delegates are managed by departmental representatives in the Enterprise Directory"

submitting org, responsible orgs for PI, CO PI with or without credit, and proposal team members with credit and any organizations providing cost share.. if they have parent orgs those are also in the chains

 ch org has its own sequence of required approvals, but each sequence is done in parallel

 we account for the fact that the same org may appear in more than one sequence (if an org approves in one sequence) it effectively approves in every sequence in which the org appears

 believe that it will only show you the approval for the org that is currently unblocked (i.e. not waiting on some subordinate approver).  So if you are (for whatever reason) you an approver for both EE and CoE, it will say that you are approving on behalf of EE.
1:09 If you happen to be an approver for two orgs in two different sequences, it will tell you that you are approving it on behalf of each org.  So if CE and ME are on the same proposal and youâ€™re an approver for both of them, it will say that you are approving on behalf of CE and on behalf of ME.
1:10 gotta run... Michael is also hanging out here, and can answer most any of these questions.
