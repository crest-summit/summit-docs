# Summit Documentation

## Contributing

The documentation makes use of a project called MkDocs (http://www.mkdocs.org/).  This tool allows documentation to be written in Markdown and compiles the Markdown into a site structure using a site template.



### Setup - Mac

In order to install everything, you'll need to drop into the command line! :O

```
